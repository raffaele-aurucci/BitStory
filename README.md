# BitStory
**BitStory is a serious game for education in computer science designed for primary school children.** 🏫

*This game is still under development and there may be some changes in the future.* 🔄

## Introduction
The **objective** of the game is to introduce children to the world of information technology, immersing them in a world inspired by the hackers room of the past, in which to get to know some of the most famous **characters** in the history of computer science.  
The player will play the role of a **child** and will have the opportunity to learn many things about computer science, through **dialogues** and **collectibles**.
In addition, he will be able to face various **computer-themed minigames** proposed by the various characters, which if passed excellently, will each award a **medal**.  
The player will be able to increase his **global score** through the progress made during the game.

## Repository contents
In **Blender** folder there are all *.blend* files realized for the world game and characters.  
The **Assets**, **Packages** and **ProjectSettings** folders are necessary for editing *Unity project*.  
In **Assets/Scenes** there are various scenes, including menu, world and minigames. In this moment only *Menu*, *World* and *AdaGame* have been developed, while the other scenes are only mockups.

## Dependencies & Configuration
For editing *.blend* files in **Blender** folder, consider to install [Blender ver. 3.5](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-5/) or higher and the add-on [Collider-Tools](https://github.com/Weisl/Collider-Tools) for changing the collider meshes apply to the models in *room.blend* file.  
For editing the *Unity project* install [Unity ver. 2021.3.21](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.21) or higher. Next, clone this repository and open in **Unity Hub**. In the end, install the package **TextMesh Pro** directly in Unity for view and changing the elements of UI.    
The scripts *.cs* in **Assets/Scripts** are editable in an IDE such as [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/).   
For changing the animations of characters use the *[name-character]@T-pose.fbx* files in **Assets/Fbx/[name-character]** folders and upload this in [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/).
